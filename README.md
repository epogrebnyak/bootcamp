# bootcamp
Accessible learning about IT, programming and data analysis for non-tech students.

### P1. Jump into programming.

> Similar to a typical entry level MOOC or edtech course in Python, that touches syntax first.

Topics: Where to run a Python program – Language syntax – Exercises – Asking questions right (MVCE) – Practice at Leetcode, Codewars, etc..

### P2. Designing programs.

> Introduction to programming, very simplified (with functional flavor and based on Python).

Topics: Values and types – Data structures, primitive and compound types – Variables – Expressions and statements – Functions – OOP and classes.
