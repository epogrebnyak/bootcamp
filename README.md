# bootcamp
Accessible curriculum in programming, data analysis and the business side of information technology for non-tech students.

### P1. Jump Into Programming.

> Start learning Python syntax and usage.

Where to run a Python program – Language syntax – Exercises – Jupyter notebooks vs plain code – Asking questions right (MWE) – Code practice at Leetcode, Codewars, and similar.

### P2. Designing Programs.

> Introduction to programming concepts.

Values and types – Data structures, primitive and compound types – Variables – Expressions and statements – Functions – OOP and classes.

### P3. Advanced Python.

> Inspired by ['Hypermodern Project Packaging' by Claudio Jolowicz](https://cjolowicz.github.io/posts/hypermodern-python-01-setup/)and ['Beyond PEP8' by Raymond Herringer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf-BqAjZb8M)

Installing Python locally – Package managers – Virtual environments – Project packaging and utilities.
Testing and continious integration (CI) – Code quality and refactoring.
Battle-tested and trending libraries – Contributing to open-source projects.
Enhancements in Python since 3.6 – Overview of metaprogramming/ABC, async/await, and performance tuning.

### Glossary

**MWE.** Minimal, workable example. A lost art of asking questions with and about code with just enough specific information. [[link](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example)]
