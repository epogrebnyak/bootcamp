# bootcamp
Accessible curriculum in programming, data analysis and the business side of information technology for non-tech students.

### P1. Jump Into Programming.

> Start learning Python syntax and usage.

Where to run a Python program – Language syntax – Exercises – Jupyter notebooks vs plain code – Asking questions right (MWE) – Code practice at Leetcode, Codewars, and similar.

### P2. Designing Programs.

> Introduction to programming concepts.

Values and types – Data structures, primitive and compound types – Variables – Expressions and statements – Functions – OOP and classes.

### P3. Advanced Python.

> Learn how to distribute your code as a package, write better code and use specific Python features.

* Installing Python locally – Package managers (pip and alternatives) – Virtual environments – Project packaging and utilities (see ['Hypermodern Project Packaging' by Claudio Jolowicz](https://cjolowicz.github.io/posts/hypermodern-python-01-setup/))
* Programming style and patterns (see ['Beyond PEP8' by Raymond Herringer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf-BqAjZb8M)) – Code quality and refactoring (see [Refactor Like A Superhero by  Alex Bespoyasov](https://github.com/bespoyasov/refactor-like-a-superhero]) – Testing and continious integration (CI) – Documentation
* Type annotations – Decorators – Iterators (`yield`) – Asyncrinous programming (`async`/`await`) and multithreading – Metaprogramming (ABC) – Performance tuning
* Foundational and trending libraries – Contributing to open-source projects.

### Glossary

**MWE.** Minimal, workable example. A lost art of asking questions with and about code with just enough specific information. [[link](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example)]
