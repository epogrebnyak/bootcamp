# bootcamp
Accessible curriculum in programming, data analysis and the business side of information technology for non-tech students.

## Programming

### P1. Jump Into Programming.

> Start learning Python syntax and usage.

* Where to run a Python program – Language syntax – Exercises – Standard library and popular packages – Jupyter notebooks vs plain code.
* Asking questions right (MWE):
  - [How to create a Minimal, Reproducible Example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example)
  - [How to debug small programs by Eric Lippert](https://ericlippert.com/2014/03/05/how-to-debug-small-programs/).
* Code practice at Leetcode, Codewars, and similar.

### P2. Designing Programs.

> Introduction to programming concepts.

Values and types – Data structures, primitive and compound types – Variables – Expressions and statements – Functions – OOP and classes.

### P3. Packaging.

> Learn how to distribute your code as a package with modern tools.

* Installing Python locally – Package managers (pip, poetry and alternatives) – Virtual environments.
* Project packaging and utilities:
  - [Hypermodern Project Packaging by Claudio Jolowicz](https://cjolowicz.github.io/posts/hypermodern-python-01-setup/).

### P4. Write Better Code.

> Patterns, refactoring, tests, documentation.

* Programming style and patterns:
  - [Beyond PEP8 by Raymond Herringer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf-BqAjZb8M).
* Refactoring:
  - [Refactor Like A Superhero by Alex Bespoyasov](https://github.com/bespoyasov/refactor-like-a-superhero)
  - [Refactoring. Improving the Design of Existing Code. by Martin Fowler, with Kent Beck](https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html).
* Unit-testing and continious integration (CI):
  - [TDD, Where Did It All Go Wrong by Ian Cooper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ05e7EMOLM).
* Writing and building documentation (sphinx, mkdocs-material, jupyterbook).

### P5. More Python Features.

> Not the first things to learn.

* Type annotations – Decorators – Iterators.
* Asynchronous programming and multithreading – Metaprogramming (ABC) – Performance tuning.

## Glossary

**MWE.** Minimal, workable example. A perished art of asking questions about code with just enough specific information. [link](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example)
